This is my awesome game about exploring a temple

Commands are entered using the command, and then the index of the item you want to interact with.
i.e) "d 3" describes the third item in more detail.
The spaces are required
use "i" to interact with an item.
i.e) "i 2" to interact with item 2, which if it is a corridor will walk through it.
You can use a tool/other item in your interaction by chaining them together
i.e) "i 4 6" will interact with item 4, using item 6. For example, interacting with a brazier, using a torch.
Each item has different actions so discover and experiment with what they do.
